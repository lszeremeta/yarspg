# YARSpg grammar for [ANTLR v4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4)

The YARSpg serialization is a special version of [YARS](https://github.com/lszeremeta/antlr-yars) for property graphs.

This project based on [ANTLR grammars-v4 project](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4).

## Testing grammar
Run tests on files in ``yarspg/examples``:

```shell
mvn clean test
```

Grammar is currently under development. Therefore, ``yarspg/examples`` contain partial examples that do not show all structures YARS structures, but correspond to the current state of grammar. More extensive examples of YARS are available in ``yarspg/next-examples``.
